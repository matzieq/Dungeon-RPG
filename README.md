# Dungeon RPG

I'm finally making and RPG.
I'm not using any frameworks, I want to write my own engine.

Now working on: displaying stats on the screen

Roadmap for the current "game moment":
- <strike>Add keyboard handling</strike>
- <strike>Add stats</strike>
- Add <strike>enemies</strike> and treasure
- Add inventory and doors

Further along:
- Add character classes and character creation
- Add menus and saves
- Add multiple dungeon levels
- Add bosses and a final goal
